1. Deploy application all the servers ( 1jvm*5min = 5min) (4jvm*5=20min)

2. restart all the 4 jvms at a time ( 1jvm*5min = 5min) (4jvm*5=20min)

Group up  the 4 jvms together ----> Cluster    1. WLM (Work Load mgt policy)  - it is distbuting the load among all your cluster members(jvms)

                                               2. Failover

2 types of clusters

1. VC    - Vertical Clustering   ---> JVM 1 JVM2 JVM3 JVM4 were installed on same machine and if you club together then it can be called as VC

adv
1. Chep

disadv

1. hard disk crashed - 4 jvms down 

2. HC    - Horizontal Clustering  ---->  JVM1 is installed in my machine , JVM2 is installed in raj machine , JVM3 is installed in abhinav machine and JVM4 is installed in Cm machine , if i club all these JVMs which are disrtbuted in the network then it can called as HC

adv 

1. if one machine hard disk is crashed , other 3 jvms machines are fine ..it is going to do failover job 

disadv

1. expensive
